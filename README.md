# Description

This project is an Information Security toolkit designed to provide secure communication through socket connections. It incorporates various encryption techniques, such as AES, PGP, public-private key cryptography, digital signatures, and signed certificates. The toolkit aims to facilitate secure data exchange between client and server applications.

# Features

## Socket Connection (Client-Server):

Establish secure socket connections between client and server for confidential data exchange.
Encryption Techniques:

## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):
Utilize AES for symmetric key encryption, ensuring data confidentiality.
## PGP (Pretty Good Privacy):
Implement PGP for secure email communication and file encryption.
## Public-Private Key Cryptography:
Enable secure key exchange between parties using asymmetric encryption.
## Digital Signatures:
Implement digital signatures to verify the authenticity and integrity of messages.
## Signed Certificates:
Use signed certificates for secure authentication and to establish trust between communicating entities.

# Installation
